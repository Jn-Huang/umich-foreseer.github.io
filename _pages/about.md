Welcome to the Foreseer Group! We are a research team within the University of
Michigan School of Information (UMSI). We work on cutting-edge research related to
data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language
processing. We build models, algorithms, and systems to analyze large
collections of text, networks, and behaviors. These techniques are applied to
solving problems in web mining, social computing, health informatics,
scientific research, and other domains with the aim to generate a positive
impact on everyoneâ€™s daily life. Our research is supported by various
government agencies such as NSF, NIH, and DARPA. We collaborate with various
industry leaders and academic partners.

Our recent interests includes, but not limited to:

- AI for Behavioral Science ([[KDD Workshop on AI Behavioral Science]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3637528.3671503), [[Turing Test for AI Chatbots, PNAS]](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2313925121))
- LLMs for Scientific Discovery ([[MASSW]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06357), [[SciLitLLM]](http://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.15545))
